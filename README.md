# My First AI
My first Python project. this project integrates the Gmail API and OpenAI to provide functionality for creating drafts and reading emails from any mailbox. This project aims to simplify email interactions by leveraging the power of OpenAI's language model and Gmail's OAuth authentication.

**Note:** This project is still a work in progress and may have limitations, particularly when searching within mailboxes.
